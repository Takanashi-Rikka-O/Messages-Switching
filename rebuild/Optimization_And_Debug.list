#	Optimization
#
1>	When child process has stopped it will return signal 'SIGCHLD' to father process.
	|
	Now,can capture that signal to do some action.So,father process does not need to check status for child process
	in cycle.

2>	When called kernel interfaces after will entry to kernel space.So must to do somework for cut back with context-switch.
	|
	Now,try to avoid for call kernel interfaces on user space,so have to reduce with view operation or file I/O.

3>	For other version of program,use 'DEBUG' macro to open features for that version.

#	Debug
#
1>	Detected error from function semop().
	|
	For the third argument,I used size of structure sembuf as parameter.
	Had been fixed that error.

2>	Context-Switch.
	|
	As much as possible reduce the action context-switch,lower to using kernel interfaces.

3>	Use signal 'SIGCHLD' to check status for child process.
	Now,not have to use if-else to check its status at second cycle of INPUT().
